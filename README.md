# Side Project: Cool Perspective Card Effect

## Description:
this project made for just fun and show some **Css** skills,



## Usage
so, because of index.html file takes image source as "/images/png-2.png " like as you can see down below

```html
<img src="/images/png-2.png" class="png-image" />
```

we need an images folder in project's root directory and inside of it we need an image file called "png-2.png"

also we need a background image as card background, for that if we looked up in **Css** file;
what we should focus on is this code:

```css
background: url(/images/bg-2.png);
```

so we need to add bg-2.png file inside of images folder.


## SUMMARY:
just put 2 images inside of images folder that you created in the project's root and you are done
